### Know how to differentiate between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.

This hierarchy of data to knowledge represents the results of taking the lower-level input (i.e., data) and processing it with business logic that uses other information you’ve already learned or processed so that you now have something more informative, useful, or valuable. Data might be the individual parts of a person’s home address; when you get updates to this data and compare it to what you have on file, you conclude that they have moved to a new location (thus, you have created information). You might produce knowledge from information like this if you look across all of your contact information and see that a lot of people change their address two or three times per year. Perhaps they’re “snowbirds,” moving with the seasons. Longer, deeper looks at such knowledge can produce powerful conclusions that you could apply in new situations.

##### data
the symbols and representations of observable facts, or the results
of performing measurements and estimates. Your name and personally identifiable
information (PII) are data elements, which consist of many different data items (your
first, middle, and surnames). Raw data refers to observations that come directly from
some kind of sensor, recorder, or measuring device (a thermometer measures tempera-
tures, and those measurements are the raw data). Processed data typically has had
compensations applied to it, to take out biases or calibration errors that we know are
part of the sensor’s original (raw) measurement process.
##### We create information from data
when we make conclusions or draw logical inferences about that data. We do this by combining it with the results of previously made deci-
sions, or with other data that we’ve collected. One example might be that we conclude
that based on your PII, you are who you claim to be, or by contrast, that your PII does
not uniquely separate you from a number of other people with the same name, leading
us to conclude that perhaps we need more data or a better process for evaluating PII.
##### knowledge 
generate from data and information when we see that broad general
ideas (or hypotheses) are probably true and correct based on that data and informa-
tion. One set of observations by itself might suggest that there are valuable mineral or
oil and gas deposits in an area. But we’ll need a lot more understanding of that area’s
geography before we decide to dig a mine or drill for oil!
##### Wisdom
is knowledge that enables us to come to powerful, broad, general conclu-
sions about future courses of action. Typically, we think of wisdom as drawing on
the knowledge of many different fields of activity, and drawing from many different
experiences within each field. This level of the knowledge pyramid is also sometimes
referred to as insight.



### Explain the difference between information, information systems, and information technology systems.
**Information** is what people use, think with, create, and make decisions with. 
**Information systems** are the business logic or processes that people use as they do this, regardless of whether the information is on paper, in electronic form, or only tacit (in their own minds). 
**Information technologies** such as paper and pen, computers, and punch cards are some of the ways you record information and then move, store, or update those recordings to achieve some purpose.

### Explain the difference between due care and due diligence. 
**Due care** is making sure that you have designed, built, and used all the necessary and prudent steps to satisfy all of your responsibilities. 
**Due diligence** is continually monitoring and assessing whether those necessary and prudent steps are achieving required results and that they are still necessary, prudent, and sufficient.

### Relate nonrepudiation and authenticity to the duties of due care, due diligence, and due process. 
There are many ways to relate security concepts to these three duties. For example, due care requires that directives, orders, or commands to take actions are authentic; that  
is, they are validated or confirmed to be coming from duly authorized persons or entities. Ongoing monitoring, as part of due diligence, should identify attempts to reverse or undo decisions, commands, or directives (such as agreements to make purchases or payments), and prevent them unless properly authorized. Nonrepudiation and authenticity support this. All organizations need ways to recognize when they’ve made a wrong decision and need to change their plans; due process requires that thoughtful, logical procedures be used to overturn any decision.

### Describe the need for making a business case related to information security issues. 
Many information security issues or problems will require changes to the ways in which the organization gets work done. These changes will cost time, money, and effort to make, and may have ongoing costs as well. Justifying the need for those changes is done with a business case, which documents and explains the rationale for the change. The business case usually does this via trade-off analysis, such as cost-benefits or risks versus rewards.

### Explain what business logic is and its relationship to information security.
Business logic is the set of rules that dictate or describe the processes that a business uses to perform the tasks that lead to achieving the required results, goals, or objectives. Business logic is often called know-how, and it may represent insights into making better products or being more efficient than is typical and, as such, generates a competitive advantage for the business. It is prudent to protect business logic so that other unauthorized users, such as competitors, do not learn from it and negate its advantage to the business.

### Explain the roles of CEOs or managing directors in a modern business. 
CEOs or managing directors are the most senior, responsible individuals in a business. They have ultimate due care and due diligence responsibility for the business and its activities. They have authority over all activities of the company and can direct subordinate managers in carrying out those responsibilities. They may report to a board of directors, whose members have longterm, strategic responsibility for the success of the business.

### Explain what a stakeholder is in the context of a business. 
A stakeholder is a person or organization that has an interest in or dependence on the successful operation of the business. Stakeholders could be investors; employees of the business; its strategic partners, vendors, or customers; or even its neighbors. Not all interests are directly tied to profitable operation of the business—neighbors, for example, may have a stake in the company operating safely and in ways that do not cause damage to their own properties or businesses.

### Explain what accountability means to information security professionals. 
Accountability measures the ways people or organizations behave to determine if they are fulfilling their obligations. Organizations must implement some form of internal controls, whether for financial or other obligations, to demonstrate that they are holding themselves accountable. These controls must be trustworthy and reliable; information security professionals contribute to ensuring this.



## kap 2

### Explain the difference between confidentiality and privacy. 
Privacy is defined in law and ethics as the freedom from intrusion by others into your life, your possessions, your place of work, or where you live. By controlling who can come into (or view)  
such private activities or places, you control what they can know about you and your activities. Confidentiality is defined in law and ethics as the requirement you place on another when you share information with them that you wish to keep private or in confidence; further disclosure by that person you share with cannot happen without your express consent.

### Explain confidentiality, integrity, and availability as they pertain to information security needs. 
Confidentiality is about protecting the investment we have made in obtaining or producing information and the competitive advantage that information investment gives us so that others cannot take the information away from us and neutralize our advantage. Integrity means that the information as a set is reliable, complete, and correct, and has been created, modified, or used only by people and processes that we trust. Availability means that the information can be extracted, produced, displayed, or output where we need it, when we need it, in the form or format we need it in, to support our decisionmaking needs. Note that if information systems cannot assure integrity, the data that is produced (i.e., available) is not reliable, and in fact could be hazardous to use in making decisions.

### Relate nonrepudiation and authenticity to information security. 
Nonrepudiation prevents one party (a sender of a message, for example) from attempting to deny that they in fact sent that message. Without this property, the recipient is at risk of loss or impact if they take action on that request. Nonrepudiation, therefore, supports integrity and accountability. Authenticity is related to nonrepudiation, but different. Authenticity provides the means for each party in a transaction or message exchange to have confidence that the other party is whom they claim to be, and that they have the right, permission, or legal authority to participate in the exchange. Without authenticity being assured, both parties are at risk of the other party being an impostor, or someone acting beyond their legal rights to do so.

### Explain the apparent conflict between privacy and security. 
Criminals, terrorists, and law-abiding citizens can all use powerful encryption, virtual private networks, and other information security technologies to protect their information and their activities from prying eyes. This causes some people to believe that protecting the privacy of the innocent is exposing others to harm. Yet these same people want their medical or financial information kept safe and securely out of the hands of criminal hackers.
### Explain what business logic is and its relationship to information security. 
Business logic is the set of rules that dictate or describe the processes that a business uses to perform the tasks that lead to achieving the required results, goals, or objectives. Business logic is often called know-how, and it may represent insights into making better products or being more efficient than is typical, and as such, generates a competitive advantage for the business. It is prudent to protect business logic so that other unauthorized users, such as competitors, do not learn from it and negate its advantage to the business
### Explain what intellectual property is and how it relates to information security.
Intellectual property consists of sets of ideas, designs, procedures, and data expressed in forms that can be used to implement business logic. Typically, a business invests considerable effort in creating its intellectual property (IP) so that it will have a significant competitive advantage over others in the marketplace. As such, that investment is worthy of protection
### Explain the roles of CEOs or managing directors in a modern business. 
CEOs or managing directors are the most senior, responsible individuals in a business. They have ultimate due care and due diligence responsibility for the business and its activities. They have authority over all activities of the company and can direct subordinate managers in carrying out those responsibilities. They may report to a board of directors, whose members have long-term, strategic responsibility for the success of the business.

### Explain what a stakeholder is in the context of a business. 
A stakeholder is a person or organization that has an interest in or dependence on the successful operation of the business. Stakeholders could be investors; employees of the business; its strategic partners, vendors, or customers; or even its neighbors. Not all interests are directly tied to profitable operation of the business—neighbors, for example, may have a stake in the company operating safely and in ways that do not cause damage to their own properties or businesses.

### Explain the difference between legal, regulatory, and ethical obligations or responsibilities as they pertain to information security. 
Legal responsibilities are defined in criminal or civil law, and they are enforced by government authorities, typically in a court of law. Regulatory responsibilities are established by government agencies that specify rules and procedures for business activities. They may have the force of law, but they were not written as laws by the legislature. Ethical responsibilities are the ideas about right and wrong behavior widely held in the society and marketplace where the business is located or functions.

### Explain why everybody needs to know about information security. 
We all make decisions, whether as employees, students, family members, or members of our society. We must put some measure of trust and confidence into the information we use when we make those decisions, and therefore, we must be able to trust where we get information from. This means holding our sources accountable and cooperating with them in their efforts to protect information by keeping it confidential, preserving its integrity, and making it available to us. We are all parts of communities of trust.

### Compare safety and security for information systems. 
Safety means operating a system in ways that do no harm, either to the system, its users, and bystanders, or to their property. Security means operating a system in ways that ensure that the information used in that system is available, of high integrity, and has been kept confidential as required. Systems with low information integrity are most likely unsafe to use or be around when they are used.

### Explain the preamble of the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics. 
The preamble reminds us that everyone’s safety and welfare depends on keeping information systems safe and secure from harm, misuse, or incorrect operation. As information systems security professionals, we have the opportunity and responsibility to ensure the safe and correct operation of these systems. As professionals, we have an obligation to one another and to society to have our actions be the standard others should aspire to.

#### Preamble
The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals, and to each other, requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior. Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.

##### Step by step of preamble 
1. Safety and welfare of society: Allowing information systems to come to harm because of the failure of their security systems or controls can lead to damage to property, or injury or death of people who were depending on those systems operating correctly.

3. The common good: All of us benefit when our critical infrastructures, providing common services that we all depend on, work correctly and reliably. 

4. Duty to our principals: Our duties to those we regard as leaders, rulers, or our supervi-
sors in any capacity.

4. Our duty to each other: To our fellow SSCPs, others in our profession, and to others in
our neighborhood and society at large.

5. Adhere and be seen to adhere to: Behave correctly and set the example for others to
follow. Be visible in performing our job ethically (in adherence with this Code) so that
others can have confidence in us as a professional and learn from our example.

### Explain the canons of the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics. 
Protect society and the infrastructures it depends on; act honorably and with integrity; provide correct, complete, professional service to those we work for and with; and help grow and maintain our profession.

#### The code:
Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence,
and the infrastructure.
Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
Provide diligent and competent service to principals.
Advance and protect the profession.

### Justify why you should follow the (ISC)2 Code of Ethics.
When you decide to be an information systems security professional, you are agreeing to the principles of the preamble and canons of that code. Not following the code places you in a contradiction—you cannot honestly protect an information system if you knowingly give incorrect, incomplete, or unprofessional advice to its owners, for example.

### Know the various data protection roles defined by GDPR. 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enacted by the European Union, defines five roles regarding the responsibilities for protecting sensitive data (data which relates to the privacy of an individual person). The first role, the subject, is the person described by or that can be identified by the data in question. The processor is a person or organization that performs tasks to create, modify, use, destroy, or share that data with others. The controller is the person or organization that establishes the purposes and intents for using the data, directs its processing, and has ultimate data protection responsibility. The custodian is a person or organization that provides storage for the data. Finally, the data protection officer is a designated official within an organization that handles protected data, who acts as the focal point for all data protection compliance issues.

## Kap 3

### What is risk?
A **risk** is the possibility that an event can occur that can disrupt or damage the organization’s planned activities, assets, or processes, which may impact the organization’s ability to achieve some or all of its goals and objectives. Risks are further classed as either **threats** or **hazards**, based on whether the action is taken by a human (or human organization) with intent, or happens because of accident, acts of nature, or system failures due to wear and tear

### Explain the information risk management process. 
Information risk management is a process that guides organizations through identifying risks to their information, information systems, and information technology systems; characterizing those risks in terms of impacts to prioritized goals and objectives; making decisions about which risks to treat, accept, transfer, or ignore; and then implementing risk treatment plans. As an ongoing management effort, it requires continuous monitoring of internal systems and processes, as well as constant awareness of how threats and vulnerabilities are evolving throughout the world.

### Explain information risk and its relationship to information systems and decision making.
You need information to make any decision, and if you cannot trust in that informa 
tion’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability when you must make a decision, then your decision is at risk. Information systems implement the processes that gather data, process it, and help you generate new information; risks that cause these processes to suffer a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability are thus information systems risks. These information systems risks further reduce your confidence that you can make on-time, accurate decisions.

### Differentiate between outcomes-based, process-based, asset-based, and threat-based views of risk. 
Each of these provides alternative ways to view, think about, or assess risks to an organization, and they apply equally to information risks or any other kind of risk.

**Outcomes-based** starts with goals and objectives and what kind of risks can impact your ability to achieve them. 

**Process-based** looks at your business processes and how different risks can impact, disrupt, or block your ability to run those processes successfully and correctly. 

**Asset-based** risks looks at any tangible asset (hardware, machinery, buildings, people) or intangible asset (knowledge, business know-how, or information of any kind) and asks how risks can decrease the value of the asset or make it lose usefulness to the business. 

**Threat-based**, AKA **vulnerability-based**, focuses on how things go wrong—what the root and proximate causes of risks might be—whether natural, accidental, or deliberately caused. Note that threats are intentional acts committed (or contemplated) by humans and human organizations, while hazards are caused by natural events, accidents, or failure due to wear and tear.

### Explain why information risk management needs to be integrated and proactive.
Information security managers and incident responders need to know the status, state, and health of all elements of the information system, including its risk controls or countermeasures, in order to make decisions about dealing with an incident of interest. The timeliness and integrity of this information is critical to detecting an incident, characterizing it, and containing it before it causes widespread damage or disruption. Integrating all elements of your information risk management systems brings this information together rapidly and effectively to enable timely incident management. To be proactive requires that you think ahead to possible outcomes of risk events, and devise ways to **deter**, **detect**, **prevent**, **contain**, or **avoid** the impacts of such events, rather than merely being reactive—waiting until an event happens to learn from it, and only then instituting risk controls for the next time such an event occurs.
### Differentiate due care from due diligence for information risk management. 
Due care and due diligence both aim to strike a prudent, sensible balance between “too little” and “too much” when it comes to implementing any set of responsibilities. 

**Due care** requires identifying information risks to high-priority goals, objectives, processes, or assets; implementing controls, countermeasures, or strategies to limit their possible impacts; and operating those controls (and the systems themselves) in prudent and responsible ways. 

**Due diligence** requires ongoing monitoring of these controls as well as periodic verification that they still work correctly and that new vulnerabilities or threats, changes in business needs, or changes in the underlying systems have not broken some of these risk control measures.

### Know how to conduct an information risk assessment. 
Start with a prioritized list of outcomes, processes, assets, threats, or a mix of these; it is important to know that you’re assessing possible risks in decreasing order of their importance or concern to leadership and management. The next step is to gather data to help make quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impact of each risk to the organization and its information, should such a risk event occur. Data from common vulnerabilities and exploitations registries (national and international) can assist by pointing out things to look for. As part of this, build a risk registry, a database or listing of the risks you have identified, your impact assessments, and what you’ve learned about them during your investigation. This combined set of information feeds into the BIA process.

### Know what a business impact analysis is, and explain its role in information risk management. 
The BIA brings together everything that has been learned in the information risk assessment process and organizes it in priority order, typically by impact (largest to smallest, soonest versus later in time, highest-priority business objective, etc.). It combines quantitative and qualitative assessments to characterize the impacts these risks might cause if they became incidents. Typically, the BIA will combine risk perspectives so that it characterizes the impacts of a risk to high-interest goals and objectives as well as to costs, revenues, schedules, goodwill, or other stakeholder interests.

### Know the role of a risk register in information risk management. 
A risk register is a document, database, or other knowledge management system that brings together everything the organization learns about risks, as it’s learned. Ideally it is organized in ways that capture analysis results, management decisions, and updates as controls and countermeasures are implemented and put to use. Like the BIA, it should be a living document or database.

### Know the difference between qualitative and quantitative assessments and their use.
**Quantitative assessments** attempt to arithmetically compute values for the probability of occurrence and the single loss expectancy. These assessments typically need significant insight into costs, revenues, usage rates, and many other factors that can help estimate lost opportunities, for example. 

**Qualitative assessments**, by contrast, depend on experienced people to judge the level or extensiveness of a potential impact, as well as its frequency of occurrence. Both are valuable and provide important insight; quite often, management and leadership will believe they do not have sufficient data to support a quantitative assessment, or enough knowledge and wisdom in an area of operations to make a qualitative judgment.

### Know how to calculate the key elements of a quantitative risk assessment. 
 **single loss expectancy (SLE**) is the total of all losses that could be incurred as a result of one occurrence of a risk. Typically expressed in monetary terms, it includes repair and restoration costs for hardware, software, facilities, data, people, loss of customer goodwill, lost business opportunity, or other costs directly attributable to the event. 
 
 **annual rate of occurrence (ARO)** is an estimate of how many times per year a particular risk is considered likely to occur. An ARO of 0.5, for example, says that this risk is expected to occur no more often than once every two years. 
 
**annual loss expectancy ALE** = *SLE* x *ARO*, and it represents the yearly expected losses because of this one risk.

### Know how to determine the safeguard value. 
The safeguard value is the total cost that may be incurred to specify or design, acquire, install, operate, and maintain a specific risk mitigation control or countermeasure. You need to first complete vulnerabilities assessments in order to know what to fix, control, or counter, however.

### Explain what MAO, RTO, and RPO mean. 
 **maximum acceptable outage (MAO)** is  the time limit to restore all mission-essential systems and services so as to avoid impact to the mission of the organization. 
 
 **Recovery time objectives (RTOs)** are established for each system that supports the organization and its missions. Organizations may set more aggressive needs for recovery, and if so, they may be spending more than is necessary to achieve these shorter RTOs. All RTOs must be shorter than the MAO that they support; otherwise, the MAO cannot be achieved. 
 
 **Recovery point objectives (RPOs)** relate to the maximum data loss that the organization can tolerate because of a risk event; they can be expressed as numbers of transactions or in units of time. Either way, the RPO represents work that has to be accomplished again, and is paced by what sort of backup and restore capabilities are in place.

### Explain threat modeling and its use in information risk assessment. 
Threat modeling starts with the premise that all systems have an external boundary that separates what the system owner, builder, and user own, control, or use, from what’s not part of the system (that is, the rest of the world and the Internet). Systems are built by putting together other systems or elements, each of which has its boundary. Thus, there are internal boundaries inside every system. Crossing any boundary is an opportunity to ask security-driven questions—whether this attempt is authorized, for an authorized purpose, at this time, for example. The external boundary of a system is thus called its threat surface, and as you identify every way that something or someone can cross a boundary, you are identifying, characterizing, and learning about (modeling) the threats with respect to that surface. The outermost threat surface can (and should) be known without needing to delve into system internal design and construction, but the real payoff is when, layer by layer, these boundaries are examined for possible trapdoors, Trojan horse “features,” or other easily exploitable weaknesses.

### Know the basic choices for limiting or containing damage from risks. 
The choices are deter, detect, prevent, and avoid. Deter means to convince the attacker that costs they’d incur and difficulties they’d encounter by doing an attack are probably far greater than anticipated gains. Detecting that an attack is imminent or actually occurring is vital to taking any corrective, evasive, or containment actions. Prevention either keeps an attack from happening or contains it so that it cannot progress further into the target’s systems. Avoiding the possible damage from a risk requires terminating the activity that incurs the risk, or redesigning or relocating the activity to nullify the risk.

#### Definition Deter, Detect, Prevent, and Avoid
##### *Deter* means to discourage or dissuade someone from taking an action because of their
fear or dislike of the possible consequences. Physical assets such as buildings may have very secure and tamper-proof doors, windows, walls, or rooflines that prevent physical forced entry. Mandatory use of multi-factor authentication. Policies and procedures can be used to train your people to make them less vulnerable to social-engineering attacks.

Deterrence can be passive, active, or a combination of the two. Fences, the design of
parking, access roads and landscaping, and lighting tend to be passive deterrence measures;
they don’t take actions in response to the presence of an attacker, for example. Active mea-
sures give the defender the opportunity to create doubt in the attacker’s mind: Is the guard
looking my way? Is anybody watching those CCTV cameras?

##### *Detect* means to notice or consciously observe that an event of interest is happening.
Notice the built-in limitation here: you have to first decide what set of events to “be on the
lookout for” and therefore which events you possibly need to make action decisions about
in real time.

If you think of how many false alarms you hear every week from car alarms or residential burglar alarms in your neighborhood, you might ask why we bother to try to detect
that an event of interest might possibly be happening. Fundamentally, you cannot respond
to something if you do not know it is happening. Your response might be to prevent or
disrupt the event, to limit or contain the damage being caused by it, or to call for help from
emergency responders, law enforcement, or other response teams. You may also need to
activate alternative operations plans so that your business is not severely disrupted by the
event. Finally, you do need to know what actually happened so that you can decide what
corrective actions (or remediation) to take—what you must do to repair what was damaged
and to recover from the disruption the incident has caused

##### *Prevent* an attack means to stop it from happening or, if it is already underway, to halt it in its tracks, thus limiting its damage.
Preventive defense measures provide two immediate paybacks to the defender: they limit
or contain damage to that which you are defending, and they cost the attacker time and
effort to get past them. Combination locks, for example, are often rated in terms of how
long it would take someone to just “play with the dial” to guess the combination or some-
how sense that they’ve started to make good guesses at it. Fireproof construction standards
aim to prevent the fire from burning through (or initiating a fire inside the protected space
through heat transfer) for a desired amount of time.

Note that we gain these benefits whether we are dealing with a natural, nonintentional
threat, an accident, or a deliberate, intentional attack.

##### avoid an attack means to change what you do, and how you do it, in such ways as to notbe where your attacker is expecting you to be when they try to attack you. 
This can be a temporary change to your planned activities or a permanent change to your operations. In this way, you can reduce or eliminate the possible disruptions or damages of an attack from natural, accidental, or deliberate causes:

Physically avoiding an attack might involve relocating part of your business or its assets
to other locations, shutting down a location during times of extremely bad weather, or
even closing a branch location that’s in too dangerous a market or location.

 Logically avoiding an attack can be done by using cloud service providers to eliminate
your business’s dependence on a specific computer system or set of services in a partic-
ular place. At a smaller scale, you do this by making sure that the software, data, and
communications systems allow your employees to get business done from any location
or while traveling, without regard to where the data and software are hosted. Using
a virtual private network (VPN) to mask your IP and Media Access Control (MAC)
addresses is another example of using logical means to avoid the possible consequences
of an attack on your IT infrastructure and information systems.

 A variety of administrative methods can be used, usually in conjunction with physical
or logical ones such as those we’ve discussed. Typically they will be implemented in pol-
icies, procedural documents, and quite possibly contracts or other written agreements.

### Know what a risk management framework is and what organizations can gain by using one or tailoring one to their needs. 
Risk management frameworks (RMFs) are compendiums of guidance based on experience in identifying, characterizing, managing, and mitigating risks to public and private organizations. RMFs, typically, are created by government agencies or international standards organizations, and they may be directive or advisory for an organization depending on the kind of business it’s in. RMFs provide rich sets of management processes that you can select from and tailor to the needs of your particular business.

### Explain the role of organizational culture and context in risk management. 
Organizations have their own “group personalities,” which may or may not resemble those of their founders or current senior leaders, managers, or stakeholders. How decisions get made, whether quantitative assessments are preferred (or not) over qualitative ones, and how the appetite for risk is determined are just some of the key elements of culture that set the context for information risk management planning and implementation.

### Describe the basic steps of the NIST Special Publication 800-37 Rev. 2 RMF.
This RMF describes seven major steps to information and privacy risk management: 
1. Prepare, 
2. Categorize, 
3. Select, 
4. Implement, 
5. Assess, 
6. Authorize, 
7. and Monitor. 

As these names, expressed as verbs, suggest, the actions that organizational leadership, management, and security or risk management specialists should take start at the broad cultural or context level, move through understanding information risk impacts, and choose, build, install, and activate new risk controls or countermeasures. Once activated, these controls are assessed for effectiveness, and senior leadership then declares them part of the new operational baseline. Ongoing monitoring ensures due diligence.

### Explain what a zero day exploit means. 
A zero day exploit involves a vulnerability discovered but not reported to the affected system’s builders, vendors, or users, or the information security community at large. Between the time of its discovery and such reporting and notification, attackers who know of the vulnerability can create an exploit with which they can attack systems affected by that vulnerability. The term suggests that the system’s defenders have zero time to prepare for such an exploit, since they are not aware of the vulnerability or the potential for an attack based on it.

### Differentiate a hazard from a threat. 
Accidents and risk events that occur because of natural causes such as weather or earthquakes are known as hazards by insurance and risk managers. These are unintentional events—weather and Nature are not conscious actors that can decide to cause damage to occur. By contrast, a threat is an action that is taken by (or contemplated to be taken) by a human being or a human organization. It is intentional; a conscious decision is made to attempt to achieve an outcome or result by making the risk event become reality. These humans are known as threat actors in risk management and security terms.

### Differentiate a security classification from a security categorization. 
Security classification is the process of identifying or estimating the possible impacts or losses an organization might suffer if information of a particular type is compromised. This compromise can relate to its confidentiality, integrity, availability, nonrepudiability, authenticity, privacy, or safety characteristics. Laws, regulations, standards, or contracts which establish compliance requirements for protecting sensitive information, combined with business impact assessments, provide the basis for developing a set of information security classification policies, procedures, and labels. Security categorization is a process which groups together sets of information that have comparable security classification and security protection needs or requirements. Categorization allows for more optimal planning and operation of security processes, and avoids the expense and risks associated with a one-size-fits-all approach that treats all data as if it is classified at the most secure level.

### Explain how classification and categorization relate to a security baseline. 
A security baseline is a matrix or table that relates data sets or types based on their classification, categorization, and required or chosen minimum essential security protection methods. This enables security planners to quickly determine which information types (by classification and category) might be put at risk when a protection method, such as an encryption or access control technology, has been shown to be no longer as secure as the organization requires it to be.

### PDCA cycle

1.  *Planning* is the process of laying out the step-by-step path we need to take to go from
“where we are” to “where we want to be.” It’s a natural human activity; we do this
every moment of our lives. Our most potent tools for planning are what Kipling called
his “six honest men”—asking what, why, when, how, where, and who of almost every-
thing we are confronted with and every decision we have to make. As an SSCP, you
need those six honest teammates with you at all times!

2. *Doing* encompasses everything it takes to accomplish the plan. From the decisions to
“execute the plan” on through all levels of action, this phase is where we see people
using new or different business processes to achieve what the plan needs to accomplish,
using the steps the plan asks for.

3. *Checking* is part of conducting due diligence on what the plan asked us to achieve
and how it asked us to get it done. We check that tasks are getting done, on time, to
specification; we check that errors or exceptions are being handled correctly. And of
course, we gather this feedback data and make it available for further analysis, process
improvement, and leadership decision making.

4. *Acting* involves making decisions and taking corrective or amplifying actions based on
what the checking activities revealed. In this phase, leaders and managers may agree
that a revised plan is needed, or that the existing plan is working fine but some indi-
vidual processes need some fine-tuning to achieve better results.



## Kap 4

### Know the major activities that are part of information risk mitigation. 
Risk mitigation is the set of activities that take identified risks and deal with them in ways management finds reasonable and prudent. Its input is the BIA, which characterizes identified risks and their likely impacts to the business. Risk mitigation planning next assesses the information and IT architectures the business depends on; assesses vulnerabilities in those architectures; and then recommends risk treatments. This leads to creating the risk mitigation implementation plan, which captures decisions as to risk treatments, implementation schedules, and verification testing needs. Once the chosen treatments (also called controls or countermeasures) are shown to be working correctly, the new security baseline (preexisting baseline plus risk reductions due to mitigations) is approved by senior leadership. Ongoing operational use is monitored, and logs and other data are reviewed, to determine the continued correct operation of the system and to maintain vigilance for new or heretofore unnoticed risks. Risk mitigation planning also identifies potential incidents of interest (which might be risks becoming reality), and the needs for alerts and alarms to initiate emergency responses and other management actions.

### Know the important security differences between the information architecture and the information technology architecture.
 
 **information architecture** focuses on how people use information to accomplish business objectives; thus, its principal security issues are involved with guiding, shaping, or constraining human behavior. Well-considered workforce education and training programs that align business objectives with information security and decision assurance needs are solid investments to make. 
 
 **IT architecture** is perceived as needing predominantly logical or technical controls that require significant expertise and knowledge to deploy and maintain effectively. This perception is true as far as it goes, but it must be driven by the needs for technical security support to the security needs of the information architecture.

### Know how to conduct an architecture assessment. 
The architecture assessment is both an inventory of all systems elements and a map or process flow diagram that shows how these elements are connected to form or support business processes and thereby achieve the needs of required business logic. This requires a thorough review and analysis of existing physical asset/equipment inventories, network and communications diagrams, contracts with service providers, software and systems change control logs, error reports, and change requests. It also should include data-gathering interviews with end users and support personnel.

### Explain the purpose and value of a systems or architecture baseline for security  purposes. 
The systems or architecture baseline, which the assessment documents, is both the reality we have to protect and the model or description of that reality. The baseline as documentation reflects the as-built state of the system today, and versions of the baseline can reflect the “build-to” state of the system for any desired set of changes that are planned. These provide the starting point for vulnerability assessments, change control audits, and problem analysis and error correcting

### Explain the importance of assessing “shadow IT” systems, standalone systems, and cloudhosted services as part of a security assessment. 
Many organizations are more dependent on IT systems elements that are not in their direct configuration management and control. As such, formal IT management may not have detailed design information, and hence vulnerability insight, about such systems elements. The information security assessment needs to identify each instance of such systems elements, and based on the BIA, determine how much inspection, investigation, or analysis of these systems (and contracts related to them, if any) need to be part of the security assessment.

### Know how to perform a vulnerabilities assessment. 
The vulnerabilities assessment gathers data about the information architecture and the IT architecture, including Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data from public sources. This data is analyzed in the context of the BIA’s prioritized impacts to determine critical vulnerabilities in these architectures. Threat modeling may also be useful in this process. The result is a list of known or suspected vulnerabilities, collated with the BIA’s priorities, for use in risk mitigation implementation planning.

### Explain the role of threat modeling in vulnerability assessment. 
Threat modeling focuses your attention on the boundaries that separate systems from one another, and from the outside world, and thus on how any request for access, service, or information can cross such boundaries. These crossing points are where legitimate users and threat actors can conceivably enter your systems. These may be tunnels (VPN or maintenance trapdoors) left open by accident, for example. Threat modeling is an important component in a well-balanced vulnerability assessment.

### Know how to include human elements in the architecture and vulnerability assessments. 
As the vulnerability assessment reviews business processes and the systems elements that support them, this may indicate process steps where end-user, manager, or other staff actions present vulnerabilities. These may be due to training deficiencies, or to weaknesses in administrative controls (such as a lack of policy direction and guidance), or they may indicate significant risks in need of physical or logical controls and countermeasures.

### Explain the basic risk treatment options of accept, transfer or share, remediate, avoid, and recast.
Once you’ve identified a vulnerability, you deal with (or treat) its associated risk with a combination of control options as required. Accepting the risk means you choose to go ahead and continue doing business in this way. Transferring the risk usually involves paying someone else to take on the work of repairs, reimbursements, or replacement of damaged systems if the risk event occurs; sharing a risk means that you transfer a portion of it to another, while the remaining (residual) risk stays with you to deal with. Remediation includes repairing or replacing the vulnerable system and is often called “fixing” or “mitigating” the risk. Avoiding a risk means to change a business process so that the risk no longer applies. The application of any risk controls may reduce the probability of occurrence or the nature of the impact of the risk, and thus you have recast (reassessed) the risk.

### Know how to determine residual risk and relate it to information security gap analysis. 
Residual risk is the risk remaining after applying treatment options, and thus  
it is a recasting of the original risk. Residual risks are in essence gaps in our defenses; gap analysis uses the same approach as vulnerability assessment but is focused on these gaps to see which if any present unacceptable levels of exposure to risk.

### Know how and why to perform an information security gap analysis. 
A gap analysis is similar to auditing a system’s requirements list against the as-built implementation; both seek to discover any needs (requirements) that are not addressed by an effective combination of system features, functions, and elements. An information security gap analysis  
can reveal missing or inadequate security coverage, and it is useful during vulnerability assessment and after mitigations have been implemented. It is performed by reviewing  
the baselined set of information security requirements (which should meet or exceed BIA requirements) against the baseline information and IT architectures, noting any unsatisfied or partially satisfied requirements.

### Know how the physical, logical, and administrative aspects of risk controls work  together.
Each of these types of controls takes a decision about security policy and practice and implements it so that people, information technology, and physical systems behaviors fit within security-approved manners. An acceptable use policy, for example, may state that employee-owned devices cannot be brought into secure work areas; a physical search of handbags and so forth might enforce this, and logical controls that detect such devices when they attempt to connect to the networks are a further layer of detection and prevention. Almost all security starts with making decisions about risks; we then write requirements, objectives, plans, or other administrative (people-facing) documents to cause those decisions to be carried out and to monitor their effectiveness.

### Explain the requirements for integrated command, control, and communications of risk treatments and countermeasures. 
Each element of our controls and countermeasures needs to be part of an interlocking, self-reinforcing whole in which elements constantly communicate information about their status, state, and health, or about any alert or alarmworthy conditions. Systems security managers should have near-seamless, real-time visibility into this information, as well as the ability to remotely manage or command systems elements in response to a suspected or actual information security event. Without this, gaps become blind spots.

### Explain the various uses of testing and verification for information assurance and security. 
Testing and verification are intended to verify that systems meet specified requirements. Testing is typically conducted in test environments, whereas verification  
can involve observations collected during testing or during ongoing operational use. Security testing and verification aim to establish how completely the information security requirements are satisfied in the deployed systems, including any risk mitigations, controls, or countermeasures that have been added to them since deployment. It validates that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information systems meets or exceeds requirements in the face of ongoing risks and threats. It can also indicate that new threats, vulnerabilities, or risks are in need of attention, decision making, and possibly mitigation

### Know why we gather, analyze, and interpret event and monitoring data. 
Almost all systems are built around the principle of “trust, but verify.” Due diligence requires that we be able to monitor, inspect, or oversee a process and be able to determine that it is working correctly—and when it is not, to be able to make timely decisions to intervene or take corrective action. Due diligence dictates that systems be built in such ways that they provide not only outputs that serve the needs of business logic but also suitable diagnostic, malfunction, or other alarm indicators. Much of these are captured in event log files by the systems themselves. IT security personnel need to gather these event logs and other monitoring data and collate, analyze, and assess it to (a) be able to recognize that an event of interest is occurring or has occurred, and (b) verify that interventions or responses to this incident are having the desired effect.

### Know the importance of elevating alerts and findings to management in a timely  manner. 
Two time frames of interest dictate how information security teams elevate alerts and findings to management. The first is in real time or near-real time, when an event of possible interest is being detected and characterized. If such an event requires emergency responses, which quite often are disruptive to normal business operations, then the right levels of management should be engaged in this decision. When not faced with an emerging situation, management needs to be apprised when ongoing monitoring, assessment, or analysis suggests that the systems are behaving either in abnormal ways or in ways indicative of previously unrecognized risks. Further investigation may involve additional staff or other resources or be disruptive to normal operations; thus, management should be engaged in a timely manner.

### Explain the role of incident management in risk mitigation.
Risks express a probability of an event whose outcome we will likely find disruptive, if not damaging, to achieving our goals and objectives. Risk mitigation attempts to limit or contain risks and to notify us when a risk event seems to be imminent or is occurring. Incident management provides the ability in real time to decide when and how to intervene to prevent further damage, halt the incident, restore operational capabilities, and possibly request support from other emergency responders. All of those incident management actions help mitigate the effects of risk on our organization and its business processes.

### Explain the importance of including operational technology (OT) systems in risk management and mitigation activities. 
Operational technology (OT) is the broad term for any kind of information systems device which physically interacts with the real world. These can include industrial process control (ICS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, smart building and environmental management systems, and safety and security systems. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, along with autonomous and mobile robotic devices, are also considered OT. If the organization has invested in (or allows the use of) any of these technologies in its buildings, vehicles, processes, or products and services, it is dependent upon them to one degree or another; that means that the vulnerabilities inherent in the OT systems (and the IT systems that monitor and control them, and inform management about their operation) are at risk.
### Explain the different functional types of risk controls.
Risks can be controlled or mitigated by means of applying one or more functional controls to them. Directive controls issue commands or guidance, and along with deterrent controls, seek to change the behavior of users and potential attackers or intruders. Preventative controls place barriers or obstacles in the way of an intruder, which both delay the intrusion and raise the effort required to accomplish it. Detective controls observe signals from systems elements and raise an alarm if those signals indicate a potential incident (an intrusion, attack, or out of limits condition) needs attention. Reactive controls take separate, independent action to respond to the incident, such as shutting down servers or closing fireproof doors. Corrective controls, similar to reactive controls, take actions that attempt to nullify, contain, or limit the impacts of an incident. Recovery controls work to restore systems, facilities, or locations back to normal operating condition. Compensating controls may provide workarounds during recovery, act as a full or partial substitute for some other required control, or augment the mitigation efforts of another control. All of these functions work together, and many individual control devices or techniques may provide any or all of these functions in combination.

### Explain the use of asset inventories and the risk register in risk mitigation. 
An asset inventory is a list of all information assets, including IT and OT elements, that the organization depends upon to achieve its goals and objectives. By ensuring that the inventory is complete, any hardware, software, communications pathways, or data that is discovered in or on the systems infrastructure that is not listed in the inventory is potentially suspect and needs to be investigated. Risk assessment, whether done as asset-based, outcomes-based,  
or process-based, will ultimately link risks (and prioritized goals and objectives) to assets, producing the risk register. Vulnerabilities associated with each asset, such as in published CVE or internal, proprietary data, are then added to the risk register. Together with the security baseline (reflecting classification and categorization decisions), this knowledge base informs change management, security assessment, and ongoing risk mitigation and security operations.

### Observe, Orient, Decide, Act loop
1. **Observe**: Look around you! Gather information about what is happening, right
now, and what’s been happening very recently. Notice how events seem to be
unfolding; be sensitive to what might be cause and effect being played out in front of
you. Listen to what people are saying, and watch what they are doing. Look at your
instruments, alarms, and sensors. Gather the data. Feed all of this into the next
step.
2.  **Orient:** Apply your memory, your training, and your planning! Remember why you are
here—what your organization’s goals and objectives are. Reflect upon similar events you’ve seen before. Combine your observations and your orientation to build the basis
for the next step.
3. **Decide**: Make an educated guess as to what’s going on and what needs to be done
about it. This hypothesis you make, based on having oriented yourself to put the “right
now” observations in a proper mental frame or context, suggests actions you should
take to deal with the situation and continue toward your goals.
4. **Act**: Take the action that you just decided on. Make it so! And go right back to the first
step and observe what happens! Assess the newly unfolding situation (what was there
plus your actions) to see if your hypothesis was correct. Check your logic. Correct your
decision logic if need be. Decide to make other, different observations.

### Residual Risk
This has been defined as the risk that’s left over, unmitigated, after you have applied a
selected risk treatment or control
### Operationalizing Risk Mitigation: Step by Step

The major steps in the risk mitigation process are: 
1. Assess the information architecture and the information technology architectures that support it.
2. Assess vulnerabilities, and conduct threat modeling as necessary.
3. Choose risk treatments and controls.
4. Implement risk mitigation controls.
5. Verify control implementations.
6. Engage and train users as part of the control.
7. Begin routine operations with new controls in place.
8. Monitor and assess system security with new controls in place.
#### Explanation

#### Step 1: Assess the Existing Architectures
We started with context and culture; now, we need to
draw a key distinction between the organization’s **information architecture** (how people
share information to make decisions and carry them out) and the **information technology**
**architecture** (the hardware, software, and communications tools) that supports that people-
centric sharing of information and decision.

##### Assessing the Information Architecture: People and Processes
###### **Organizational Political and Cultural Context**
Organizational culture is the sum of all of the ways, written and unwritten, in which
organizations make decisions and carry them out. Quite often, the organizational culture
reflects the personalities and personal preferences of its founders, stakeholders, leaders, or
key investors. Two key aspects of organizational culture that affect information security
planning and operations are its willingness to accept or take risks and its need for control.
Being risk-averse or risk-tolerant is a measure of an appetite for risk, whether that risk
is involved with trying something new or with dealing with vulnerabilities or threats. The
higher the risk appetite, the more likely the organization’s decision makers are to accept
risk or to accept higher levels of residual risk.

###### **The Information Architecture: Business Processes and Decision Flow**
Once again, the SSCP is confronted with needing insight and knowledge about what
the organization does, how it does it, and why it does it that way—and yet much of that
information is not written down. For many reasons, much of what organizations really
do in the day-to-day of doing their business isn’t put into policies, procedures, or training
manuals; it’s not built into the software that helps workers and managers get jobs done.

It’s also a lot easier to do process vulnerability assessments on expliciprocess knowledge than it is to do them when that knowledge resides only inside someone’s mind (or muscle memory)

##### The Information Architecture: Business Processes and Decision Flow
One good way of understanding what the organization’s real IT architecture is would be
to do a special kind of inventory of all the hardware, software, data, and communications ele-
ments of that architecture, paying attention to how all those elements interact with one another
and the business processes that they support. Such an information technology baseline provides the foundation for the information security baseline—in which the organization documents its information security risks, its chosen mitigation approaches, and its decisions about residual risk.

#### Step 2: Assess Vulnerabilities and Threats

It’s all about finding the cause-and-effect logic underneath the “what could go wrong”
parts of our systems. Recall from Chapter 3 our discussion of proximate cause and root cause:

Finding the *root cause* of a vulnerability helps us focus on what to fix so that we can
eliminate or reduce the likelihood of that component or system failing.

 Finding the *proximate cause* helps us find better ways to detect failures while they are
starting to happen, contain the damage that they can cause, and offers an opportunity
to take corrective action before the damage gets worse.

In this way you combine your search for possible vulnerabilities with identifying candidate *indicators of compromise* (IOCs).

##### Vulnerability Assessment as Quality Assurance

verify correct  design and implementation can help us identify possible vulnerabilities:

**Data quality assurance** looks end-to-end at everything involved in the way the organization acquires external data, how it generates its own data internally, and what it does with the data. It captures the business logic that is necessary to say that a given input is correct in content, in meaning, and in format. Then it enforces business logic that restricts the use of that data to valid, authorized processes and further specifies who in the organization can use those processes. In addition, data quality can and should identify exceptions—cases where an unforeseen combination of data values requires human (supervisory or managerial) decisions regarding what, if anything, to do with such exceptions.
*Software quality assurance* also is (or should be!) an end-to-end process, which starts with the system functional requirements that document what the software needs to do to properly implement business logic and deliver the correct results to the end users. 
*Software source code*
*Communications and network* systems should have suitable features built in and turned on so that usage can be monitored and controlled.

##### CVSS consists of three areas of concern:

*Base metrics*, which assess qualities intrinsic to a particular vulnerability. These look at
the nature of the attack, the attack’s complexity, and impacts to confidentiality, integ-
rity, and availability.
*Temporal metrics*, which characterize how a vulnerability changes over time. These
consider whether exploits are available in the wild, and what level of remediation
exists; they also consider the level of confidence in the reporting about a vulnerability
and exploits related to it.
*Environmental metrics*, which assess dependencies on particular implementations or
systems environments. These include assessments of collateral damage, what percent
of systems in use might be vulnerable, and the severity of impact of an exploit (ranging
from minimal to catastrophic).

##### Gap Analysis

**Gap** places where the functions performed by one element of the system do not quite meet the expectations or needs of the next element in line in a process chain. 

Several different kinds of activities can generate data and insight that feed into a gap
analysis:
 Review and analysis of systems requirements, design, and implementation documentation
Software source code inspection (manual or automated)
Review of software testing procedures and results
Inspections, audits, and reviews of procedures, facilities, logs, and other documentation, including configuration management or change control systems and logs
Penetration testing
Interviews with end users, customers, managers, as well as bystanders at the workplace

#### Step 3: Select Risk Treatment and Controls

Risk treatment involves all aspects of taking an identified risk and applying a set of
chosen methods to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of its occurrence, the impacts it
has on the organization when (not if) it occurs, or both.

##### Risk Treatment Strategies

**Accept** This risk treatment strategy means that you simply decide to do nothing about the risk. You recognize it is there, but you make a conscious decision to do nothing differently to reduce the likelihood of occurrence or the prospects of negative impact. This is known as being *self-insuring*—you assume that what you save on paying risk treatment costs (or insurance premiums) will exceed the annual loss expectancy over the number of years you choose to self-insure or accept this risk. *Note* that accepting a risk is not taking a gamble or betting that the risks won’t ever materialize. That would be ignoring the risk. A simple example of this is the risk of having
**Transferring or sharing a risk** means that rather than spend our own money, time, and effort to reduce, contain, or eliminate the risk, we assign responsibility for some or all of it to someone else. There is a real moral hazard in some forms of risk transference, and the SSCP should be on alert for these.
	EX: Insuring your home against fire or flood transfers the risk of repairing or replacing your home and possessions to the insurance company
**Remediate or Mitigate (Also Known as Reduce or Treat)** this means that we find and fix the vulnerabilities to the best degree that we can; failing that, we put in place other processes that shield, protect, augment, or bridge around the vulnerabilities. Most of the time this is *remedial action*—we are repairing something that either wore out during normal use or was not designed and built to be used the way we’ve been using it. *Mitigating* the risk is something you aim to do before a failure occurs, not after!
**Avoid or Eliminate** You avoid a risk either by eliminating the activity that incurs the risk or moving the affected assets or processes to locations or facilities where they are not exposed to the risk.
**Recast** he never-ending effort to identify risks, characterize them, select the most important ones to mitigate, and then deal with what’s left. Recasting the risk usually requires that first you clearly state what the new residual risk is, making it more clearly address what still needs to be dealt with

##### PLA 
**Physical controls** are combinations of hardware, software, electrical, and electronic mechanisms that, taken together, prevent, delay, or deter somebody or something from physically crossing the threat surface around a set of system components you need to protect
**Logical (or Technical) Controls** Here is where you use software and the parameter files or databases that direct that software to implement and enforce policies and procedures that you’ve administratively decidedare important and necessary. It is a bit confusing that a “policy” can be a human-facing set of rules, guidelines, and instructions, and a set of software features and their control settings.
**Administrative Controls** In general terms, anything that human organizations write, state, say, or imply that dictates how the humans in that organization should do business (and also what they should not do) can be considered an administrative control. Policy documents, procedures, process instructions, training materials, and many other forms of information all are intended to guide, inform, shape, and control the way that people act on the job. 

#### Step 4: Implement Controls
**Controls**, also called *countermeasures*, are the active steps we take to put technologies,
features, and procedures in place to help prevent a vulnerability from being exploited and
causing a harmful or disruptive impact. Controls can perform one or more functions,
which we’ll express in their adjective form (such as reactive)

The most common functions needed for controls include:
**Directive**: Commands or guidance given to people or entities to effect a change in
their behavior.

**Deterrent**: Persuade or influence an attacker to postpone an attack, or abandon it in
progress. Typically, deterrent controls act to increase the difficulty of an intrusion or
attack, which subliminally attempts to convince the attacker that their efforts will be
futile, require more effort and expense, or place them at greater risk of being detected
and possibly apprehended by law enforcement.
 
 **Preventative**: Blocks or impedes an action or event from taking place. Preventative (also
referred to as preventive) controls are also known as safeguards because they guard
valuable assets as they attempt to keep them safe from intrusion, loss, or other harm.

**Detective**: Determine that signals from sensing devices are indicators of compromise
(IoCs), intrusion, or some other out-oflimits condition, and then notify other elements
of the security system so that they may respond.

**Reactive**: Also called countermeasures, these controls take a separate, additional action
in response to detecting an attack.

**Corrective**: As a class of reactive controls, these take actions that are designed or
selected to attempt to contain, limit, or eliminate the harmful agent(s) or elements of the
attack, so as to prevent the damage or impact from spreading. Corrective controls also
can contribute to making an attack location safer for first responder personnel to enter,
assess the scene, and take prompt action. Corrective controls in and of themselves do
not usually do anything to restore, recover, or repair the systems elements damaged or
impacted by the attack.

**Recovery**: Assists with or performs tasks to restart or restore to normal operational con-
dition those systems elements that were impacted by an attack.

#### Step 5: Authorize: Senior Leader Acceptance and Ownership
The C-suite and the board of directors are the ones who operate the business
in the names of the owners and stakeholders. They “own” the bad news when due diligence
fails to protect the stakeholder’s interests

This has two vital spin-offs for risk management programs, plans, and processes:
1. It requires senior leadership to set the priorities, establish the success criteria, and then fund, staff, and resource the risk management plans in line with those priorities.
2. It requires senior leadership to celebrate the successes of these risk management programs and processes, as well as own up to their failures and shortcomings.

## Kap 5 

### Explain the relationship between the TCP/IP protocol and the OSI 7-layer reference model. 
Both the TCP/IP protocol, established by the Internet Engineering Task Force, and the OSI reference model, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), lay out the fundamental concepts for networking and the details of how it all comes together. Both use a layers-of-abstractions approach, and to a large degree, their first four layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, and Transport) are nearly identical. TCP/IP stops there; the OSI reference model goes on to define the Session, Presentation, and Application layers. Each layer establishes a set of services, delivered by other protocols, which perform functions that logically relate to that layer—however, a number of important functions must be cross-layer in design to actually make important functions work effectively. TCP/IP is often thought of as the designer’s and builder’s choice for hardware and network systems, as a bottom-up set of standards (from Physical on up to Transport). The OSI reference model provides a more cohesive framework for analyzing and designing the total information flow that gets user-needed purposes implemented and carried out. SSCPs need to be fluent in both.
#### OSI and TCP/IP side by side
![[Pasted image 20240816131520.png]]

### Explain why IPv6 is not directly compatible with IPv4. Users of IPv4 encountered a growing number of problems as the Internet saw a many-fold increase in number of attached devices, users, and uses. 
First was IPv4’s limited address space, which needed the somewhat cumbersome use of Network Address Translation (NAT) as a workaround. The lack of built-in security capabilities was making far too many systems far too vulnerable to attack. IPv4 also lacked built-in quality of service features. IPv6 resolves these and a number of other issues, but it essentially is a completely different network. Its packet structures are just not compatible with each other—you need to provide a gateway-like function to translate IPv4 packet streams into IPv6 ones, and vice versa. Using both systems requires one

of several alternative approaches: tunneling, “dual-stack” simultaneous use, address and packet translation, or Application layer gateways. As of 2018, many large systems operators run both in parallel, employ tunneling approaches (to package one protocol inside the other, packet by packet), or look to Application layer gateways as part of their transition strategy.

### Compare and contrast the basic network topologies. A network topology is the shape  or pattern of the way nodes on the network are connected with each other. 
The basic topologies are point-to-point, bus, ring, star, and mesh; larger networks, including the world-spanning Internet, are simply repeated combinations of these smaller elements. A bus connects a series of devices or nodes in a line and lets each node choose whether or not it will read or write traffic to the bus. A ring connects a set of nodes in a loop, with each node receiving a packet and either passing it on to the other side of the ring or keeping it if it’s addressed to the node. Meshes provide multiple bidirectional connections between most or all nodes in the network. Each topology’s characteristics offer advantages and risks to the network users of that topology, such as whether a node or link failure causes the entire network to be inoperable, or whether one node must take on management functions for the others in its topology. Mesh systems, for example, can support load leveling and alternate routing of traffic across the mesh; star networks do load leveling, but not alternate routing. Rings and point-to-point cannot operate if all nodes and connections aren’t functioning properly; bus systems can tolerate the failure of one or more nodes but not of the backplane or system of interconnections. Note that the beauty of TCP/IP and the OSI 7-layer reference model as layers of abstraction enable us to use these topologies at any layer, or even across multiple layers, as we design systems or investigate issues with their operation and performance.

### Explain the different network roles of peer, client, and server. Each node on a network interacts with other nodes on the network, and in doing so they provide services to each other. 
All such interactions are governed by or facilitated by the use of handshake protocols. If two interconnected nodes have essentially equal roles in those handshakes—one node does not control the other or have more control over the conversation—then each node is a peer, or equal, of the other. Simple peer-to-peer service provision models are used for file, printer, or other device sharing, and they are quite common. When the service being provided requires more control and management, or the enforcement of greater security measures (such as identity authentication or access control), then the relationship is more appropriately a client-server relationship. Here, the requesting client node has to make a request to the server node (the one providing the requested services); the server has to recognize the request, permit it to proceed, perform the service, and then manage the termination of the service request. Note that even in simple file or print sharing, the sharing may be peer-to-peer, but the actual use of the shared resource almost always involves a service running on the node that possesses that file or printer, which carries out the sharing of the file or the printing of the requesting node’s data

### Explain how IPv4 addressing and subnetting works. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, which is defined as four 8-bit portions, or octets. 
These addresses in human-readable form look like 192.168.2.11, with the four octets expressed as their base 10 values (or as two hexadecimal digits), separated by dots. In the packet headers, each IP address (for sender and recipient) occupies one 32-bit field. The address is defined to consist of two parts: the network address and the address of a node on that network. Large organizations (such as Google) might need tens of thousands of node addresses on their network; small organizations might only need a few. 

This has given rise to **address classes**: 
**Class A** uses the first octet for organization and the other three for node. 
**Class B** uses two octets each for organization and node. 
**Class C** uses three octets for organization and the fourth for node on the Internet; 
**Class D** and E are reserved for special purposes. 

Subnetting allows an organization’s network designers to break a network into segments by logically grouping addresses: the first four devices in one group, the next four in another, and so on. This effectively breaks the node portion of the address into a subnet portion and a node-on-the-subnet portion. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number in four-octet IP address format, with 0s in the rightmost bit positions that indicate bits used to assign node numbers: 255.255.255.240 shows the last 4 bits are available to support 16 subnet addresses. But since all networks reserve address 0 and “all bits on” for special purposes, that’s really only 14 node addresses available on this subnet. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) simplifies the subnetting process and the way we write it: that same address would be 255.255.255.240/28, showing that 28 bits of the total address specify the network address.

### Explain the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 approaches to subnetting. 
IPv4’s use of a 32-bit address field meant that you had to assign bits from the address itself to designate a node on a subnet. IPv6 uses a much larger address field of 128 bits, which for unicast packets is broken into a 48-bit host or network field, 16 bits for subnet number, and 64 bits for the node address on that network segment. No more borrowing bits!

### Explain the role of port numbers in Internet use. 
Using software-defined port numbers (from 0 to 65535) allows protocol designers to add additional control over routing service requests: the IP packets are routed by the network between sender and recipient, but adding a port number to a Transport layer or higher payload header ensures that the receiving system knows which set of services to connect (route) that payload to. Standardized port number assignments make application design simpler; thus, port 25 for email, port 80 for HTTP, and so on. Ports can be and often are remapped by the protocol stacks for security and performance reasons; sender and recipient need to ensure that any such mapping is consistent, or connections to services cannot take place.

### Describe the man-in-the-middle attack, its impacts, and applicable countermeasures. 
In general terms, the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can happen when a third party can place themselves between the two nodes and either insert their own false traffic or modify traffic being exchanged between the two nodes, in order to fool one or both nodes into mistaking the third party for the other (legitimate) node. This can lead to falsified data entering company communications and files, the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of services and business processes. Protection at every layer of the protocol stack can reduce or eliminate the exposure to MITM attacks. Strong Wi-Fi encryption, well-configured and enforced identity management and access control, and use of secure protocols as much as possible are all important parts of a countermeasure strategy.

### Describe cache poisoning and applicable countermeasures.
Every node in the network maintains a local memory or cache of address information (MAC addresses, IP addresses, URLs, etc.) to speed up communications—it takes far less time and effort to look it up in a local cache than it does to re-ask other nodes on the network to re-resolve an address, for example. Cache poisoning attacks attempt to replace legitimate information in a device cache with information that could redirect traffic to an attacker, or fool other elements of the system into mistaking an attacker for an otherwise legitimate node. This sets the system up for a man-in-the-middle attack, for example. Two favorite targets of attackers are ARP and DNS caches. A wide variety of countermeasure techniques and software tools are available; in essence, they boil down to protecting and controlling the server and using allowed listing and blocked listing techniques, but these tend not to be well suited for networks undergoing rapid growth or change.

### Explain the need for IPSec, and briefly describe its key components. 
The original design of the Internet assumed that nodes connecting to the net were trustworthy; any security provisions had to be provided by user-level processes or procedures. For the 1960s, this was reasonable; by the 1980s, this was no longer acceptable. Multiple approaches, such as access control and encryption techniques, were being developed, but these did not lead to a comprehensive Internet security solution. By the early 1990s, IPSec was created to provide an open and extensible architecture that consists of a number of protocols and features used to provide greater levels of message confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation protection. It does this first by creating security associations, which are sets of protocols, services, and data that provide encryption key management and distribution services. Then, using the IP Security Authentication Header (AH), it establishes secure, connectionless integrity. The Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP) protocol uses these to provide confidentiality, connectionless integrity, and anti-replay protection, and authenticates the originator of the data (thus providing a degree of nonrepudiation).

### Explain how physical placement of security devices affects overall network information security. 
Physical device placement of security components determines the way network traffic at Layer 1 can be scanned, filtered, blocked, modified, or allowed to pass unchanged. It also directly affects what traffic can be monitored by the security system as a whole. For wired and fiber connections, devices can be placed inline—that is, on the connection from a secured to a non-secured environment. All traffic therefore flows through the security device. Placement of the device in a central segment of the network (or anywhere else) not only limits its direct ability to inspect and control traffic as it attempts to flow through, but may also limit how well it can handle or inspect traffic for various subnets in your overall LAN. This is similar to host-based versus LAN-based antimalware protection. Actual placement decisions need to be made based on security requirements, risk tolerance, affordability, and operability considerations. 

### Describe the key security challenges with wireless systems and control strategies to use to limit their risk. 
Wireless data communication currently comes in three basic sets of capabilities: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and near-field communication (NFC). All share some common vulnerabilities. First, wireless devices of any type must make a connection to some type of access point, and then be granted access to your network, to affect your own system’s security. Second, they can be vulnerable to spoofing attacks in which a hostile wireless device can act as a man-in-the-middle to create a fake access point or directly attack other users’ wireless devices. Third, the wireless device itself is very vulnerable to loss or theft, allowing attackers to exploit everything stored on the device. Mobile device management (MDM) solutions can help in many of these regards, as can effective use of identity management and access control to restrict access to authorized users and devices only.

### Explain the use of the concept of data, control, and management planes in network security. 
All networks exist to move data from node to node; this requires a control function to handle routing, error recovery, and so forth, as well as an overall network management function that monitors the status, state, and health of network devices and the system as a whole. Management functions can direct devices in the network to change their operational characteristics, isolate them from some or all of the network, or take other maintenance actions on them. These three sets of functions can easily be visualized as three map overlays, which you can place over the diagram of the network devices themselves. Each plane (or overlay) provides a way to focus design, operation, troubleshooting, incident detection, containment, and recovery in ways best suited to the task at hand. This is not just a logical set of ideas—physical devices on our networks, and the software and firmware that run them, are built with this concept in mind.

### Describe the role that network traffic shaping and load balancing can play in information security. 
Traffic shaping and load balancing systems attempt to look at network traffic (and the connections it wants to make to systems resources) and avoid overloading one set of links or resources while leaving others unused or under-utilized. They may use static parameters, preset by systems administrators, or dynamically compute the parameters  
they need to accomplish their tasks. Traffic shaping is primarily a bandwidth management approach, allocating more bandwidth for higher-priority traffic. Load balancing tries to spread workloads across multiple servers. This trending and current monitoring information could be useful in detecting anomalous system usage, such as a distributed denial-ofservice attack or a data exfiltration taking place. It may also provide a statistical basis for what is “normal” and what is “abnormal” loading on the system, as another indication of a potential security event of interest in the making. Such systems can generate alarms for outof-limits conditions, which may also be useful indicators of something going wrong.

### Explain the two different security concerns regarding DNS and the countermeasures  to deploy to mitigate their risk. 
First, the DNS itself as an infrastructure can be abused by attackers, who can use it to create in effect their own command and control architecture with which they can direct subsequent attack activities on a wide variety of target systems. This transforms a trustworthy infrastructure into one of increasing risk to users. Mitigating against this risk requires more widespread implementation of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) by Internet service providers (ISPs), the operators of the Internet backbone and DNS services, and by end user organizations alike. Second, attackers can misuse DNS capabilities to misdirect user queries (via spoofing and other techniques), which can result in  
the download of malware or other payloads for the attacker to use. User organizations can mitigate this risk with a combination of approaches, including more effective filtering by firewalls, such as increased deep inspection of DNS related traffic (into and out of the organization), more effective blocked/allowed list management, and other techniques.

### Explain the relationship between data loss prevention and network security. 
Data loss prevention (DLP) seeks to identify suspicious movements of data within the organization’s infrastructure, both laterally (east-west) and across its outer perimeter (northbound into the Internet, southbound into the organization or into deeper security domains within the infrastructure). Such movements may be attempts by attackers to take high-value data sets, fragment them, encrypt them, and then exfiltrate them for later exploitation. From a network security perspective, this requires all the techniques of intrusion detection and prevention, access control, traffic control, and network and systems monitoring and analysis. In the worst case, the sophisticated DLP attack is comparable to building a TOR-like anonymizing virtual network within the target enterprise’s infrastructure, masking both the sources and the destinations of the data, the data itself (via encryption), and the routing of the data to its ultimate destination.

### Explain what a zombie botnet is, how to prevent your systems from becoming part of one, and how to prevent being attacked by one.
A zombie botnet is a collection of computers that have had malware payloads installed that allow each individual computer to func 
tion as part of a large, remotely controlled collective system. (The name suggests that the owner of the system and the system’s operating system and applications don’t know that the system is capable of being enslaved by its remote controller.) Zombie botnets typically do not harm the individual zombie systems themselves, which are then used either as part of a massively parallel cycle-stealing computation, as a DDoS attack, or as part of a distributed, large-scale target reconnaissance effort. Reasonable and prudent measures to prevent your systems from becoming part of a zombie botnet include stronger access control, prevention of unauthorized downloading and installation of software, and using effective, up-to-date antimalware or antivirus systems.

### Explain what a DMZ is and its role in systems security. 
From a network security perspective, the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is that subset of organizational systems that are not within the protected or bastion systems perimeter. Systems or servers within the DMZ are thus exposed to larger, untrusted networks, typically the entire Internet. Public-facing Web servers, for example, are outside of the DMZ and do not require each Web user to have their identity authenticated in order to access their content. Data flows between systems in the DMZ and those within the protected bastion must be carefully constructed and managed to prevent covert paths (connections into the secure systems that are not detected or prevented by access controls) or the exfiltration of data that should not go out into the DMZ and beyond.

### CIANA Layer by layer

#### CIANA at Layer 1: Physical
##### Vulnerabilities
We need to consider two kinds of physical transmission: *conduction* and *radiation*.
Conducted and radiated signals are easy prey to a few other problems:

**Spoofing** happens when another transmitter acts in ways to get a receiver to mis-
take it as the anticipated sender. This can happen accidentally, such as when the
RFI (radio frequency interference) from a lightning strike is misinterpreted by an
electronic device as some kind of command or data input. More often, spoofing is
deliberate.

 **electromagnetic interference (EMI);** Large electrical motors, and electric power systems, can generate this. this tends to be very low frequency but can still disrupt some Layer 1
activities.

 **Interception** happens when a third party is able to covertly receive and decode the signals being sent, without interrupting the flow from sender to receiver.

**Jamming** occurs when a stronger signal (generated deliberately, accidentally, or naturally) drowns out the signal from the transmitter

The Exploiter’s Tool Kit: 
*Cable taps* (passive or with active repeaters)
*Cables* plugged into unused jacks on your switches, routers, or modems
*Tampering* with your local electrical power supply system

##### Countermeasure Options

Enclose signal cables in rigid pipes and embed them in the ground or concrete to reduce the risk of interference and tampering.

Use frequency bands, encoding techniques, and other measures to minimize accidental or deliberate interference in radio communications.

Place communication system components (Layer 1 and others) in physically secured, environmentally controlled spaces to mitigate risks.

Use power conditioning equipment to prevent problems caused by noise, voltage drops, or spikes in the power supply.

Conduct regular inspections and audits of physical systems against a controlled and well-documented baseline, especially since most IPS and IDS cannot detect intrusions at Layer 1.

#### CIANA at Layer 2: Data Link
##### Vulnerabilities
**MAC address–related attacks**, MAC spoofing (command line accessible), CAM (con-
tent addressable memory) table overflow

**DHCP lease-based denial of service attack** (also called IP pool starvation attack)

**ARP attacks**, attacker sending IP/MAC pairs to falsify IP address for known MAC, or
vice versa

**VLAN attacks**: VLAN hopping via falsified (spoofed) VLAN IDs in packets

Denial of service by looping packets, as a **spanning tree protocol (STP) attack**

**Reconnaissance attacks** against Data Link layer discovery protocols

**SSID spoofing** as part of man-in-the-middle attacks
##### Countermeasure Options

Secure your network against external sniffers via encryption.

**** Use **SSH** instead of unsecure remote login, remote shell, etc.

 Ensure maximum use of **SSL/TLS**.
 
 Use secured versions of email protocols, such as **S/MIME or PGP**.
 
 Use **network switching techniques**, such as dynamic ARP inspection or rate limiting of ARP packets.
 Control when networks are operating in promiscuous mode.
 
 Use **allowed listing** of known, trusted MAC addresses.
 
 Use **blocked listing** of suspected hostile MAC addresses.
 
 Use **honeynets** to spot potential DNS snooping.
 
 Do **latency checks**, which may reveal that a potential or suspect attacker is in fact monitoring your network.
 
**Monitor** what processes and users are actually using network monitoring tools,
such as Netmon, on your systems; when in doubt, one of those might be serving an
intruder!

#### CIANA at Layer 3: Network
##### Vulnerabilities
**IP spoofing.**

**Routing (RIP) attacks**.

 **ICMP attacks**, including Smurf attacks, which use ICMP packets in a DDoS attack
against the victim’s spoofed IP address.

 **Ping flood.**
 
 **Ping of Death attack** (ICMP datagram exceeding maximum size: if the system is
vulnerable to this, it will crash); most modern OSs are no longer vulnerable.

 **Teardrop attack** (false offset information into fragmented packets: causes empty or
overlapping spots during reassembly, leading to receive system/app instability).

 **Packet sniffing reconnaissance**.
##### Countermeasure Options
**Securing ICMP**

Securing routers and routing protocols with packet filtering (and the ACLs this
requires)

**Provide ACL protection** against address spoofing
